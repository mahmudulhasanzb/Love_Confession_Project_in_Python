💌 Love Confession Project :
A playful, interactive app built with Python and Tkinter to make a lighthearted love confession. Input your crush's name, ask the big question, and see how they respond! This app also incorporates animated images and a fun "No" button that moves around when pressed, making for a humorous experience.


📋 Features

Animated "No" Button: The "No" button avoids the user's click by changing positions randomly.
